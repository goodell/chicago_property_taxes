The definitions of these codes are maintained by the field workers. Unfortunately, the way this data is entered makes it impossible to distinguish between a 1 & 2 and a 12, making this field mostly useless.

This field is a combination of original age and effective age where original age refers to the oldest component of the building and effective age is a relative judgement due to renovations or other improvements. For instance, if a property is completely demolished and built up again, the age resets to 1. But if portions of the original structure are kept, it may be more complicated to determine the age.
